    <h3>End Users</h3>
    <p>My end users are children around 8-9 years old. Kids at this age need simple controls and gameplay.</p>
    <p>They may enjoy pixel-like games and gameplay, which may be more appealing to them.</p>
    <p>Moreover, I set up more vivid expressions and animations, which can make the players more interested</p>
   
    
    
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>Our 3D modeling program aims to explore and apply digital modeling techniques to create high-quality 3D models.</p>
    <p>The project combines key technologies such as modeling software, texture mapping, rendering and animation to provide customized solutions for different application scenarios.</p>
    <p>Whether it's game development or product design, our goal is to create detailed and creative 3D work.</p>
    <p>Our 3D modeling projects aim to create high-quality 3D models using modern modeling techniques for applications in games, animation, architectural visualization and more.</p>
    <p>We use the professional software Blender for modeling</p>



    <h3>üé® Aesthetics:</h3>

    <p>Aesthetic considerations are the way that my character looks visually overall.</p>
    <p>This is important because a well-designed character enhances immersion,</p>
    <p>reinforces the game's artistic style, and makes the character more engaging to players</p>
    <p>I addressed my character,s aesthetics by carefully selecting colors, shapes, and textures that fit the game's theme,</p> 
    <p>ensuring a balanced silhouette,</p>


    <h3>‚öôÔ∏è Functionality: </h3>

    <p>Functionality ensures that the character works properly within the game.   This is important because a character that moves smoothly,</p>
    <p>interacts correctly with the environment, and performs actions as expected enhances gameplay and player experience.</p>
    <p>I addressed the functionality of my character  for efficient animation,</p>
    <p>and testing the model in a game engine to check for performance issues or rendering errors.</p>

    <h3>Requirements: Body</h3>
    <p>Size: Rectangular, medium, light green</p>
<h3>Requirements: Head</h3>
<p>Size: Square, face with sunglasses, light green, blue above the sunglasses</p>
<h3>Requirements: Feet</h3></h3>
<p>Specifications: Four squares, two front two back, the front two connected together, the back two connected together</p>

<h3>üñ•Ô∏è Usability:</h3>

<p>Usability affects how easily players can understand and interact with my character.  </p>
<p>This is important because a well-designed character should clearly communicate its role, actions,</p>
<p>and purpose in the game, enhancing player experience</p>
<p>Players can easily use and understand my character because I maintained a readable silhouette that stands out in the game environment.</p>

<h3>üõ°Ô∏è Intellectual Property:</h3>
<p>Intellectual property protects original ideas from being copied. </p>
<p>This is important because it ensures that people's jobs are not stolen</p>
<p>In order to make sure that my character is original, I changed the original colors, expressions and so on</p>
